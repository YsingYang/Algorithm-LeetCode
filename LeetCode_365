//Interesting Math problem , It can be abstracted as a Euclidean alorithm .But I'm figure out it....Thanks for ShuangquanLi 
sharing his explanation.

class Solution {
public:
    bool canMeasureWater(int x, int y, int z) {
        return z == 0 || z <= (long long)x + y && z % gcd(x, y) == 0;
    }
    
    int gcd(int x,int y){
        if(y>x)
            swap (x,y);
        while(y){
            int temp = y;
