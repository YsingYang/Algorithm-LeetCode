//Randomized algorithm . But I have no idea how to improve its runtime , Maybe it's a question about efficient Randomization? 

class Solution {
vector<int> ori,ran;
public:
    Solution(vector<int> nums) {
        ori = ran = nums;
    }
    
    /** Resets the array to its original configuration and return it. */
    vector<int> reset() {
        return ori;
    }
    
    /** Returns a random shuffling of the array. */
    vector<int> shuffle() {
        int size=ran.size();
        for(int i=size-1;i>=1;--i){
            swap(ran[i],ran[rand()%(i+1)]);
        }
        return ran;
    }
};
