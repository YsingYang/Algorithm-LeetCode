/*
  It's the easiest problem I have met in Leetcode,but why it have extraordinarily low acceptance.Oh I find the answer in discuss
  just because most of people are used to use (f+r)/2 to get the mid.hah,Thanks for my roomate Ken_Lee instruct me to use 
  f+((r-f)>>1) to compute mid. This is indeed a good habit
